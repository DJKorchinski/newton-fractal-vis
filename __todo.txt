TODO: 
- Add a way to update the render size?
    - render size?
    - fullscreen button?
    - arbitrary grid space resolution (to enable super sampling / subsampling?)
- add a way to navigate the fractal? (zoom in / out, pan?)
- Add a pop-up settings panel? 
- clear page button? 
- button to hide the description? 
- add a button to adjust the order of the fractal? Can we input an arbitrary polynomial? 
- gpu acceleration? (hard to make this compatible with arbitrary polynomials probably, unless we write some clever js -> shader code)
